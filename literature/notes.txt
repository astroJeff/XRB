-------------XRB-cluster separation (observation)-------------

Kaaret et al. (2004)
	- X-ray populations in M82, NGC 1569, and NGC 5253
	-* X-ray sources are located near star clusters
	-* Brighter x-ray sources are closer than fainter x-ray sources
	- Displacements typically 10-1000 pc

Rangelov et al. (2011)
	- XRBs and star clusters in NGC 4449
	- XRBs from Chandra, clusters from HST
	- 50% of XRBs have young, BH accretors
	-* Compile a list of distances, ages to nearest clusters

Rangelov et al. (2012)
	- Matches X-ray and optical data of Antennae galaxies
	- A quarter of XRBs are (near) coincident with star clusters
	-* XRBs with black holes tend to remain within star cluster

Poutanen et al. (2013)
	- ULXs are (slightly) separated from clusters in the Antennae
	- Formed from BHs (M_i > 40 M_sun)
	- Ejections must be due to N-body scattering (are you sure?)

-------------XRB-cluster separation (theory)-------------

Sepinsky et al. (2005)
	- Use StarTrack to generate a population
	- Place generated population within a cluster potential
	- Distributions of XRB displacements from their host cluster

Kalogera et al. (2007) - conference proceedings
	- Use StarTrack to generate a population
	- Place objects in a Plummer potential
	- Compare avg separation for different times, cluster masses
	- Massive clusters affect separation, slowing down binary

Shtykovskiy & Gilfanov (2007)
	- Generate a spatially resolved SFH over past 100 Myr
	- Correlate HMXB position with spatially resolved SFH 

Zuo & Li (2010)
	- Model X-ray binaries to match separation/luminosity trend
	- Use their own version of BSE/Hurley 2002
	- Constrain model parameters
	- Use a birth cluster potential
	- alpha_CE causes significant differences

Mapelli et al. (2011)
	- ~44% of black hole binaries are ejected within 10 Myr
	- 3-body interactions change the binary's separation, eccentricity
	- Focus specifically on ULXs

Zuo (2015)
	- Follow Zuo & Li (2010) to test different kick velocities
	- BH kicks are likely lower velocity
	- NS kicks must be a few 100 km/s

-------------Black holes in clusters (theory)-------------

Mapelli & Zampieri (2014)
	- Simulate BH binaries using stellar evolution and N-body
	- Use STARLAB which combines N-body with SEBA
	- Focus on BH binaries with RLOF, different metallicities
	- Specifically compare to ULXs

Goswami, Kiel, & Rasio (2014)
	- Combine stellar evolution with N-body - CMC code
	- Use more (factor of 100) stars than Mapelli & Zampieri (2014)
	- Rate of BH ejection from clusters depends on cluster density
	- Stellar dynamics unimportant in low density environments

Garofali et al. (2012)
	- N-body simulations of NGC 4449 - from Rangelov et al. 2011
	- Only extremely compact clusters can form BHBs dynamically
	- N-body - SAPPORO (GPU), stellar evolution - STARLAB
	-* XRBs in NGC 4449 are likely formed primordially
