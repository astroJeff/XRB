We want to call subroutine star in star.f:

SUBROUTINE star(kw,mass,mt,tm,tn,tscls,lums,GB,zpars)

kw = stellar type
mass = Initial stellar mass
mt = current stellar mass (Msun)
tm = Main sequence lifetime
tn = Nuclear burning lifetime (assuming no further mass loss)
tscls = Evolution timescales for different stages
lums = Landmark luminosities
GB = Giant branch parameters
zpars = Parameters for distinguishing various mass intervals
